I’ve always been fascinated by biology, and soon after earning my bachelor's, I started as a lab technician at Caltech’s neuroscience department. There, I worked on projects exploring neuronal networks using mice, zebra finches, and flies as model organisms. I honed my skills in DNA cloning, cell culture, and various bench techniques.

What intrigued me most was seeing PhD students shift away from the bench to focus on data analysis. That’s when I realized the power of computational approaches in biology. This curiosity led me to pursue a master’s in computational biology, where I analyzed 60 metagenomes (1.5 TB of data) for my thesis. Since then, I’ve taken on diverse bioinformatics projects, bridging my lab experience with large-scale data analysis to uncover new biological insights.
